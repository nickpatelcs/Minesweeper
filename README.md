# Minesweeper
The classic Minesweeper game coded in Python3 using CMU Graphics.

A replicated version of Minesweeper in Python3, programmed as a creative task for the CMU 15-112 course. Makes use of recursion to clear out large areas of zeroes on the board.

## CMU Graphics

CMU Graphics is a persistent-object graphics package geared towards beginner computer science students. CMU Graphics and its desktop version are maintained by [CMU CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/), a Carnegie Mellon University project which develops free-to-use middle and high school computer science curriculum.


From there, the syntax for using the graphics package is identical to the browser-based version of the framework. You can find more details about how to use the graphics framework here on our [documentation page](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/docs).
